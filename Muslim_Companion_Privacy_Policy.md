# Privacy Policy – Muslim Companion
**Effective date:** January 21, 2026

Muslim Companion ("the app") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data the app processes and why.

## Information the app processes
- **Location (optional):** If you grant location permission, the app uses your approximate or precise location to determine your city, calculate prayer times, and show Qibla direction. You can also enter your city manually.
- **Notifications & exact alarms:** Used to deliver prayer reminders and Athan at the correct time.
- **Media / images (optional):** If you use Image Studio, the app may access:
  - Camera (when you choose **Take Photo**)
  - Photos you select via the system picker (when you choose **Upload Image**)
  - Images you save to your device (when you tap **Save**)
- **App settings:** Stored on your device (language, calculation method, notification toggles, selected reciter, etc.).

## Advertising
The app shows ads (banner and full-screen) provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect data in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not sell your personal data to advertisers. You can remove ads by upgrading to Premium (in-app purchase).

## What the app does NOT do
- No account creation or login (except optional Apple Sign-In for restoring in-app purchases, if used)
- No selling of personal data
- No collection of sensitive personal information beyond what's needed for enabled features

## Data storage
- Most data is stored locally on your device (settings and cached content).
- Downloaded content (Quran pages, audio, backgrounds) may be cached locally to improve performance.
- In-app purchases are processed by Apple; we do not store your payment details.

## Network access / third-party services
The app connects to the internet to provide features such as:
- **Prayer times:** external API (e.g., Aladhan)
- **Qibla map tiles:** OpenStreetMap tiles (in WebView)
- **Quran resources / backgrounds / reciter config:** remote content (e.g., GitHub-hosted JSON/images) and reciter audio hosts
- **Advertising:** Google AdMob

These providers may receive standard technical information (e.g., IP address) during normal internet communication.

## Permissions (why we ask)
- **Location:** prayer times & Qibla based on your location  
- **Notifications:** prayer reminders / Athan  
- **Exact alarms:** trigger Athan at exact prayer time  
- **Camera:** take a photo for Image Studio  
- **Photos:** select images for Image Studio  
- **Internet / network state:** fetch prayer times, resources, and ads  

## Children's privacy
The app is not designed to collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted at this URL.
