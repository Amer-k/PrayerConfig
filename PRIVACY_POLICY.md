# Privacy Policy – Muslim Companion

**Effective date:** January 21, 2026

Muslim Companion (“the app”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what data the app processes and why.

---

## Information the app processes

- **Location (optional):** If you grant location permission, the app uses your approximate or precise location to determine your city, calculate prayer times, and show Qibla direction. You can also enter your city manually.

- **Notifications & exact alarms:** Used to deliver prayer reminders, Athan at the correct time, and optional reminders for Azkar and Quran.

- **Media / images (optional):** If you use Image Studio, the app may access:
  - Camera (when you choose **Take Photo**)
  - Photos you select via the system picker (when you choose **Upload Image**)
  - Images you save to your device (when you tap **Save**)

- **App settings:** Stored on your device (language, calculation method, notification toggles, selected reciter, theme, etc.).

---

## Advertising

The app shows ads provided by **Google AdMob**. AdMob may collect or use data (such as advertising ID, device information, and usage data) to serve and measure ads. This is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [AdMob’s program policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543). You can control ad personalization in your device settings (e.g. **Opt out of Ads Personalization** in Android).

---

## What the app does NOT do

- No account creation or login
- No selling of your personal data to third parties
- No collection of sensitive personal information beyond what’s needed for the features you enable

---

## Data storage

- Most data is stored locally on your device (settings and cached content).
- Downloaded content (Quran pages, audio, backgrounds) may be cached locally to improve performance.

---

## Network access / third‑party services

The app connects to the internet to provide features such as:

- **Prayer times:** external API (e.g. Aladhan)
- **Qibla / map tiles:** OpenStreetMap tiles (where used)
- **Quran resources, backgrounds, reciter config:** remote content (e.g. GitHub‑hosted JSON/images) and reciter audio hosts
- **Advertising:** Google AdMob (see Advertising section above)

These providers may receive standard technical information (e.g. IP address) during normal internet use.

---

## In‑app purchases

If you purchase Premium (remove ads), the transaction is processed by **Google Play**. We do not store or have access to your payment details. Google’s terms and privacy policy apply to those transactions.

---

## Optional crash / incident reports

If you choose to send an incident report (e.g. after a crash), the app may attach diagnostic logs to an email. This is optional and under your control. We use such information only to help fix issues.
